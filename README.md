# Color Chaser

Color Chaser is an interactive project where hovering over squares triggers a playful color-shift effect. After a short delay, the squares return to their original color.

## How to Use

- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.
- Hover over the squares to watch the color-changing effect.

## Customization

- Modify the `colorsList` array in the `index.js` file to change the available colors.
- Adjust the number of squares and rows by changing the `squares` and `rows` variables.
- Change the delay duration for color reset by modifying the `delay` variable.
